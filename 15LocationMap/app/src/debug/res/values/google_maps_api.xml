    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    5D:32:14:02:51:29:0F:B7:EE:13:4E:6A:11:7F:F4:48:02:DC:AC:C0

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
